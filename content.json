Instead, they were taken hostage by terrorists and spent three scorching days cramped in a school gym without food or water. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beslan_school_siege' target='_blank' class='hero-link'>This act of terror</a> took the lives of 334 people, 186 of them were children."

            "description1": "Flowers of Beslan is a handcrafted memorial that honors the 334 lives lost in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beslan_school_siege' target='_blank' class='hero-link'>the 2004 Beslan school tragedy</a>  through individually crafted paper poppies. Each delicate flower serves as a 'data portrait'. Its petals, height, and features are carefully designed to tell the story of one person — their fate during the attack, their age, their gender, and their connection to others.",
            "description2": "Created during one year of meticulous work, this project transforms statistics into a living field of remembrance, where every flower stands as both a personal tribute and part of a collective visualization of loss. The poppy field 'grows' in School No.1's assembly hall — now part of Beslan memorial center — where bullet-marked walls still bear witness to the events of September 1-3rd 2024.",
            "description3": "The installation is accompanied by an ambient soundscape: fainted music of Ossetian folk instrument Ӄisyn-Fændyr and the sounds of water, the water that the hostages so desperately needed."

The years pass, but the memory does not fade. On the contrary, each anniversary feels heavier than the last. I needed to find a way to process this – to make sense of it all. So I decided to create a handcrafted 'data-portrait' for each of the victims, something that would stand as an individual tribute while collectively creating a visual representation of the true scale of the lost lives.",

Initially, I planned to create flowers for all 1,116 people trapped in the school. (According to other sources they were 1128). The flowers would be color-coded to show if a person survived, was injured, or died, while age and gender would be encoded in the flower's elements.\n\nMy concept involved grouping flowers of family members together to show that these weren't just individual hostages – they were families, friends, and colleagues. This piece of data was the most difficult to collect, and there were many unknowns until the last day.\n\nI even considered including additional details to make the installation more personal: identifying teachers and highlighting the 24 women and babies released on September 2nd. This would have allowed viewers to trace stories like that of Aneta Gadieva, who faced an impossible choice between her daughters.",

After creating initial prototypes, I realized this wasn't the right medium. The flowers were too time-consuming to create, and simply didn't have the tender and realistic look I envisioned.\n\nOne December day at a Christmas market in Stockholm, I discovered crépe paper flowers made by Hanna Nyman (@backtopoetry). Their lifelike delicate beauty opened up a world of possibilities. And I dove into it, learned and experimented for a couple of months. My teacher and the master of paper flowers <a href='https://www.sofiavusirjansson.com/' target='_blank' class='process-link'>Sofia Vusir Jansson</a> played an instrumental part on that journey, sharing her tips and tricks for bringing my technique to another level.",

The most crucial information needed to be visible at first glance, while secondary details could reveal themselves upon closer inspection. That's why I reserved petal color – the most immediately noticeable element – to represent a person's fate.\n\nFor age representation, flower size seemed logical, but I needed to ensure smaller flowers for children wouldn't be overshadowed. My solution was to give smaller flowers taller stems, effectively using both size and height to highlight young lives.\n\nTo show gender, I experimented with various approaches: different flower types, rounded petals for women versus pointed for men, flowers with stamen for men versus flowers without stamen for women. Through testing, I arrived at a simpler solution: darker stamens for male flowers, lighter ones for female flowers.",

Their support, combined with the possibility of installing the flowers in the school itself, gave me a clear purpose and deadline.\n\nCreating each flower involved multiple steps: crafting stems and pistils, cutting out stamens and petals, shaping petals, and final assembly. I strived to make each flower unique by experimenting with techniques like coloring paper with ink and coffee, often achieving unexpected and beautiful results.\n\nThis project also connected other people to the tragedy of Beslan.

So I changed the scope and focused instead on the deceased. This decision, while difficult, allowed me to give each flower the attention and care it deserved. \n\nThe change in scope meant that I needed to consider not only the hostages, but also those who died fighting the terrorists and saving others: civilian rescuers, professional rescuers and members of Russian anti-terrorism special forces. \n\nThis forced me to drastically experiment with coloring paper to find the right shades to represent these people.

Just one day before my departure from Ossetia, we brought the installation to life.
